# Basic Flex and Bison examples

This part of the repository is a gentle introduction to flex and bison
based on the source text _flex & bison_ as discussed in the main
README.md of this repository. An overview of the examples follows:

### english2american.l
A cute little example of using flex to build a naive translator, in this
ingesting British English sentences and spitting out American English
sentences in return

### scanner.l
A scanner for the components of numeric equations

### wc.l
An extremely basic clone of the faily standard wc Unix command
