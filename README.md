# flex_n_bison
A place for me to experiment with flex and bison for fun

Flex and Bison are probably the _premier_ lexing and parsing utilities today.
Having a general interest in computational theory and compilation, I've
decided it's time to get intimately acquainted with these tools.  In particular,
an eventual goal is to design a programming language for fun and for my own
education. This repository will document that journey.
